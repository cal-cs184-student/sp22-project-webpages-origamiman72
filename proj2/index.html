    <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
    <p>
        In this project, we implemented capabilities for rendering three-dimensional meshes. This ranged from implementing de Casteljau's
        algorithm for Bezier surfaces, to implementing operations on mesh data structures. Specifically, we gained experience operating on
        a halfedge-based mesh data structure to implement edge flips, splits, and loop subdivision for upscaling. We also learned how shading of these meshes can be
        implemented, through interpolating normal vectors of vertices present in the mesh. Overall, it was exciting to gain
        insight into how irregular objects in graphics can be represented as mesh structures.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 1: Bezier curves with 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>de Casteljau's algorithm is a recursive algorithm for generating Bezier curves. This algorithm takes as input n
        control points, as well as a parameter t.
        It returns a point on the Bezier curve defined by the provided control points. At each step of the algorithm,
        the n control points are grouped two at a time
        from left to right and linearly interpolated, with the interpolation weighted according to the provided t
        parameter. This provides n-1 intermediate control points. The algorithm repeats recursively
        on the intermediate control points until only one point is returned; this point lies on the Bezier curve. By
        running this algorithm many times with different values of t,
        we can generate a Bezier curve.

    <h3 align="middle">Part 2: Bezier surfaces with separable 1D de Casteljau subdivision</h3>

    <p>de Casteljau's algorithm can be extended to create Bezier surfaces in three dimensions. To do so, we take in an
        input of k arrays
        which contain n three-dimensional points each, and two parameters, u and v. For each of the k arrays, we
        evaluate a point on the Bezier curve
        defined by the n points in the array and the parameter u, as in part 1. Then, once we have these k points from
        the k Bezier curves, we use these
        k points as control points and the parameter v to generate a point on a Bezier curve which goes through the ones
        defined by the arrays. This generated
        point lies on the Bezier surface. We can run this algorithm many times for different values of u and v to create
        a Bezier surface.</p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 3: Average normals for half-edge meshes</h3>
    <p> We implemented the area-weighted vertex normals by first calculating the normals of each of the faces around the
        vertex. For this we traversed the faces around the vertex using the halfedges and then used the built-in normal
        function for each face. Since each normal was not normalized, we could use it to calculate the area of the face
        by using the formula: 1/2 * (magnitude of normal vector). <br/><br/>

        We then added the area * normal vector of each face to a cumulative vertex normal, then normalized and returned
        the result. </p>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 4: Half-edge flip</h3>

    <p> Implementation of the edge flipping task was quite difficult at first. We had trouble understanding exactly what
        needed to be changed in all of the mesh elements,
        and we attempted to implement this entire task without consulting rigorous visual aid with labeled elements. As
        a result, our code quite unstructured, messy, and difficult to debug.
        The most important change we made in our approach after having frustration debugging was to use a labeled visual
        guide of the half-edges and vertices. We rewrote the method from scratch
        and the first thing we did was put all of the mesh elements from the diagram directly into the code. This is in
        contrast to what we were doing originally, which was essentially to just
        compute mesh elements on the fly from the flipped edge - a needlessly complicated process. Naturally,
        calculating all relevant mesh elements up front was a massive step-up in terms of readability and simplicity and
        made implementation of this method quite simple. </p>

        </td>
    </div>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 5: Half-edge split</h3>
    We implemented the edge split operation by first storing different variables for each element in the mesh. We then
    wrote down which new elements needed to be created and instantiated them. We went through each of the new vertices,
    faces, and edges and set their halfedges to the relevant halfedges. To add the new vertex, we took the parameter
    edge e0 and changed one of its vertices to be the new vertex. We then took the halfedges of e0 and modified them so
    that they were still the halfedges of e0, but only between the original vertex of e0 and the new vertex. We
    reassigned the pointers of all modified halfedges according to their new positions.<br/><br/>

    While we were debugging, naming each of the edge/face/vertex variables with clear names (e.g. ab for an edge between
    a and b) helped significantly.

        </table>
    </div>

    <h3 align="middle">Part 6: Loop subdivision for mesh upsampling</h3>
    We implemented the loop subdivision by first iterating through every edge in the mesh and calculating the new
    positions for each of its endpoints as well as the new vertex to be placed at its midpoint. We then iterated again
    through the edges of the mesh and split all edges that were not new edges. We also updated the positions of the
    newly created vertices in this step. Since splitting an edge added new edges onto the end of the mesh, we broke out
    of the loop as soon as we discovered the first new edge. We then iterated again through the edges and for each new
    edge in the vertex, we checked if it was connecting an old vertex and a new vertex and if so, we flipped it.
    <br/><br/>

    To update the original vertices, we iterated through each vertex and if it was not a new vertex, we updated its
    position to the new position stored within it. Finally, to facilitate future subdivisions, we set the isNew variable
    for each edge and vertex to false.


    <h4> Smoothing effect </h4>
    <p>One thing to notice is that when doing loop subdivision, sharp edges and corners quickly "smooth out" and become level with the
        rest of the mesh. Here's an example on a modified icosahedron: </p>
    <div align="middle">
    <td>
        <img src="images/ico1.png" align="middle" width="550px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Default mesh; no loop subdivision, sharp edges present. </figcaption>
    </td>
    <td>
        <img src="images/icoSmooth.png" align="middle" width="550px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Loop subdivision applied once; sharp components become level with the rest of the mesh, smoothing present</figcaption>
    </td>
    <td>
        <img src="images/icoSmooth2.png" align="middle" width="550px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Loop subdivision applied twice. Significantly smoothed compared to default mesh; features from default mesh far less apparent, only distinguishing feature is a flat area </figcaption>
    </td>
        <td>
            <img src="images/split.png" align="middle" width="550px"/>
            <figcaption align="middle">We can preserve the features a bit more if we do some pre-splitting. I split the edge in the "canyon" at the top of the icosahedron, then applied loop subdivision applied twice. This appears to have preserved slightly more of the "canyon" than the non-split case, as more variation in depth can be seen. </figcaption>
        </td>
    </div>

    <h4> Asymmetry effect on cube.dae </h4>
    Note that when we loop subdivide a cube mesh, it becomes asymmetric as shown:
    <div align="middle">
        <td>
            <img src="images/cube1.png" align="middle" width="550px"/>
            <figcaption align="middle">Default cube mesh</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="images/cube2.png" align="middle" width="550px"/>
            <figcaption align="middle">Loop subdivision applied once, notice slight asymmetries developing</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="images/cube2new.png" align="middle" width="550px"/>
            <figcaption align="middle">Loop subdivision applied twice; becoming slightly more asymmetric.</figcaption>
        </td>
    </div>

    <h4> Creating symmetry </h4>
    To cause the mesh to be symmetric under loop subdivision, we can flip the bottom edge of the default mesh like so:

    <div align="middle">
        <td>
            <img src="images/preflip.png" align="middle" width="550px"/>
            <figcaption align="middle">This causes the mesh elements themselves to be completely symmetric; before, the edges were not symmetric</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="images/loop1.png" align="middle" width="550px"/>
            <figcaption align="middle">Mesh after one loop subdivision.</figcaption>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="images/loop2.png" align="middle" width="550px"/>
            <figcaption align="middle">Opposite end of the mesh after one loop subdivision; notice how the geometry of the surface repeats.</figcaption>
